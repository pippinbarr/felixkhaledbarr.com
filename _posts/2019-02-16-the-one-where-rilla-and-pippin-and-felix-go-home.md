We stayed with Felix in the hospital from the Sunday of his birth through to Friday, so five and a bit days in the end. By the end he was putting on weight and had survived a brief "jaundice moment" where the device they use to measure jaundice (via photography) suggested he was high, but then the actual blood serum test suggested he was actually not in any trouble. (Just another in the long line of technologies that work differently for different skin tones, it seems. Great.)

We got the all clear from the pediatrician on Friday morning, and our wonderful colleague and friend Jonathan was able to drive to the hospital with his infant car seat to pick us up (they don't let you leave hospital without having the baby in a car seat). With Jonathan's able assistance (and rather too much laughing in the car for Rilla's post-caesarian state), we rolled home through the ice and the slush of Montr√©al's interminable winter.

Now that we're back, we're working on establishing routines that will help us survive these early weeks of sleeplessness and cluelessness. We're off to a pretty good start, and our great friend Anke already brought us soup! We're tired (especially Rilla and even more especially Felix), but we're home.

Kasper, Felix's older brother (and our cat), has been sweetly curious about Felix. It'll be fun to watch their relationship develop.

(For what it's worth, this pace of updates will more than likely slow down as things settle, but for now you know what we know!)
