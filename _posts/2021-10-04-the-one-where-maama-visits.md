This is Felix’s maama^uncle, asad chishti. In South Asian culture and linguistics, a maama or maamu is the brother/cousin of the mother, in this case Rilla aapa^sister.

Felix is now “2 and three quarters old”, as Pippin bhai^brother said. I have not seen him since Fall 02019 since I reside in Whitehorse, Yukon and, well, COVID-19 when he was closer to three quarters of a year old!

It is remarkable how much Felix has grown and unfolded into his own personhood during this time and in this place. How much more homely this already-cozy home feels because of his singing, running around, design aesthetic and more. 

I will be in and out of town the next few weeks, fingers crossed, so expect a few more updates but don’t hold your breath.
