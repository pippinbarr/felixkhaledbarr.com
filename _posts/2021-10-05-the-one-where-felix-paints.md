*Another day, another ~~dollar~~ baller?* 

Hmm, let me try again. 

*Another day, 
less smaller, 
fkb keeps growing taller!*

The days fly by when you are having fun. Both Rilla aapa and me are on sabbatical and the days are packed. The clock is Felix, more than once I have remarked, *“We are on Felix time now”*. There is something beautifully fortunate about how synchronized Pippin bhai and Rilla aapa seem and it feels very nourishing to be here in place and time and company (including especially Kasper the cat, **child #1**).

Felix walked down the stairs in the morning before daycare asking, *“Where is auntie?”*. While it is too early to say that he is channeling my parents in his concerns about my eligible bachelor status, the case is mounting for him being in cahoots with them. 

There were many edible and incredible nourishing moments for today. First and foremost: Rilla aapa’s egg curry and khichdi, both of which were quite a bit different (yet similar) to the way my mama prepares the same dishes.

Felix is a real natural with the watercolour paints and rather than just going off-script decided to go off the page. Let us hope it is washable!
