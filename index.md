# Chapter 1. The New Guy.

___In which: Pippin and Rilla have a son now!___

Some of you already know the story because we excitedly emailed you at the time, but for everyone else:

Our son was born on Sunday, 10 February 2019, early in the morning. He came as a surprise, four weeks early. In fact, we were at a programming demo night when Rilla's waters broke just before she was due to present one of her research projects. We headed home, called the hospital, were told to come in, went in, found out he was in breech, went through an unplanned c-section, and found ourselves sitting in the recovery area with this new, tiny person.

Since then, we've remained at the hospital (I'm writing this on the following Wednesday night) because he has to pass a number of tests as a pre-term baby. He's nailed the blood-glucose exam (had to resit it a couple of times admittedly), and is working on the "get heavier" challenge. We hope to be heading home soon.

We're feeling very good about having him out here with us and so far it's been an experience of complete newness and confusion alongside a feeling of everything being normal and exactly as its meant to be.

He's called Felix Khaled Barr.
